This branch is the code used in the "Hugo-clr: Parsing Web Pages with Clojure-clr and HtmlAgilityPack" 
blog post.  It is a rehashing of code I wrote using Clojure on the JVM to help me investigate Clojure 
in the CLR world.

The code parses all of the 2000's Hugo Awards Pages and grabs the Best Novel category and writes them
to a comma delimited text file.
